//! Creation Kit automation with required workarounds
//!
//! This module provides utilities for running the Fallout 4 Creation Kit (CK) in automated
//! workflows. The Creation Kit is notoriously difficult to automate due to several quirks
//! and limitations that require workarounds.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The main interface is [`CreationKitRunner`], which handles:
//! - Precombined mesh generation (`-GeneratePrecombined`)
//! - PSG compression (`-CompressPSG`)
//! - CDX building (`-BuildCDX`)
//! - Previs data generation (`-GeneratePreVisData`)
//!
//! # Critical Workarounds (DO NOT REMOVE)
//!
//! ## Workaround #1: DLL Management
//!
//! **Problem:** CreationKit crashes when ENB or ReShade DLLs are loaded.
//!
//! **Solution:** The [`DllGuard`] automatically renames interfering DLLs before CK runs
//! and restores them afterward. Files renamed:
//! - `d3d11.dll` → `d3d11.dll-PJMdisabled`
//! - `dxgi.dll` → `dxgi.dll-PJMdisabled`
//! - `enbimgui.dll` → `enbimgui.dll-PJMdisabled`
//! - And several others (see `dll_manager` module)
//!
//! **This is NOT optional - CK WILL CRASH without this.**
//!
//! See original batch script lines 422-427, 330-335.
//!
//! ## Workaround #2: Log Parsing Instead of Exit Codes
//!
//! **Problem:** CreationKit exit codes are unreliable and cannot be used to determine
//! success or failure. CK often exits with non-zero codes after successful operations,
//! and sometimes exits with code 0 even when operations failed.
//!
//! **Solution:** Every CK operation:
//! 1. Deletes the old log file before starting
//! 2. Runs CreationKit
//! 3. Parses the new log file for known critical error patterns
//! 4. Ignores exit codes entirely (logs them as warnings only)
//!
//! **This is NOT inefficient code - it's the ONLY way to detect CK errors.**
//!
//! See [`check_log_for_errors`](CreationKitRunner::check_log_for_errors) for details.
//!
//! # Error Detection
//!
//! Two critical error patterns are detected:
//!
//! - [`HANDLE_LIMIT_ERROR`]: CK ran out of object handles (mod too complex)
//! - [`PREVIS_ERROR`]: Previs generation failed for some cells
//!
//! # Mod Organizer 2 Support
//!
//! When configured with [`with_mo2`](CreationKitRunner::with_mo2), CreationKit is launched
//! through MO2's virtual file system. This ensures CK sees mods in the correct load order.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::path::Path;
//! use generateprevisibines::tools::creation_kit::CreationKitRunner;
//! use generateprevisibines::config::BuildMode;
//!
//! let ck_exe = Path::new("C:\\Games\\Fallout4\\CreationKit.exe");
//! let fo4_dir = Path::new("C:\\Games\\Fallout4");
//! let log_file = Path::new("C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Fallout4\\CreationKit.log");
//!
//! let runner = CreationKitRunner::new(ck_exe, fo4_dir)
//!     .with_log_file(log_file);
//!
//! // Step 2: Generate precombined meshes
//! runner.generate_precombined("MyMod.esp", BuildMode::Clean)?;
//!
//! // Step 7: Generate previs data
//! runner.generate_previs("MyMod.esp")?;
//! # Ok::<(), anyhow::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! # See Also
//!
//! - `dll_manager` module for DLL renaming implementation
//! - Original batch script (`GeneratePrevisibines.bat`) for historical context
//! - Project CLAUDE.md for detailed workaround documentation

///
/// # Solutions
///
/// 1. Split the mod into smaller plugins
/// 2. Reduce object count in cells
/// 3. Simplify complex areas
/// 4. Use filtered mode instead of clean mode (reduces object count)
///
/// # Detection

/// Checked in `check_log_for_errors()` after every CreationKit operation.

///
/// # When This Occurs

///
/// This is a **FATAL ERROR** for workflow purposes. Even if some cells generated previs

///
/// # Solutions

/// 1. Identify problematic cells from the log

/// # Key Features
///
/// - **DLL Guard**: Automatically disables ENB/ReShade DLLs that crash CK
/// - **Log Parsing**: Detects errors from log files since CK exit codes are unreliable

///
/// # Important Workarounds (DO NOT REMOVE)
///
/// **REQUIRED WORKAROUND #1: DLL Management**
///
/// CreationKit crashes when ENB or ReShade DLLs (d3d11.dll, dxgi.dll, etc.) are loaded.
/// The `DllGuard` automatically renames these files before CK runs and restores them afterward.
/// See original batch script lines 422-427, 330-335.
///
/// **This is NOT optional optimization - CK WILL CRASH without this.**
///
/// **REQUIRED WORKAROUND #2: Log Parsing Instead of Exit Codes**
///
/// CreationKit frequently exits with non-zero status codes even on successful operations.
/// Exit codes alone are UNRELIABLE for determining success/failure. Instead, this runner:
/// - Deletes old log files before each operation
/// - Parses the new log file for known critical error patterns
/// - Ignores non-zero exit codes if the log shows success
///
/// **This is NOT code smell - exit codes cannot be trusted.**
///
/// # Critical Errors Detected
///
/// - **`OUT OF HANDLE ARRAY ENTRIES`**: CK ran out of internal object handles (mod too complex)
/// - **`visibility task did not complete`**: Previs generation failed for some cells

    /// - `generate_previs` performs ADDITIONAL checks for `PREVIS_ERROR` pattern
