//! FO4Edit automation with required keyboard automation workarounds
//!
//! This module provides utilities for running FO4Edit in automated workflows. FO4Edit is
//! the community-created tool for editing Fallout 4 plugins and running batch scripts.
//! Unlike CreationKit, FO4Edit is designed to be more scriptable, but it still has
//! significant automation challenges that require workarounds.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The main interface is [`FO4EditRunner`], which handles:
//! - Merging PrecombineObjects.esp into the main plugin (`Batch_FO4MergeCombinedObjectsAndCheck.pas`)
//! - Merging Previs.esp into the main plugin (`Batch_FO4MergePrevisandCleanRefr.pas`)
//! - Automated script execution with keyboard automation
//! - Log file parsing for error detection
//!
//! # Critical Workarounds (DO NOT REMOVE)
//!
//! ## Workaround #1: Keyboard Automation for Module Selection Dialog
//!
//! **Problem:** FO4Edit displays a "Module Selection" dialog even when launched with the
//! `-autoexit` flag and a pre-configured `Plugins.txt` file. There is NO headless mode,
//! NO command-line option to suppress this dialog, and NO way to automate it except via
//! keyboard input.
//!
//! **Solution:** The [`send_enter_keystroke`](FO4EditRunner::send_enter_keystroke) function uses the
//! Windows `SendInput` API to:
//! 1. Wait for the FO4Edit window to appear (3-second delay)
//! 2. Find the window by title "FO4Edit"
//! 3. Bring the window to the foreground
//! 4. Send ENTER key press + release events
//!
//! **This is NOT code smell - it's the ONLY way to automate FO4Edit.**
//!
//! See original batch script lines 499-511 for the same workaround using PowerShell.
//!
//! ## Workaround #2: Force Close After Script Completion
//!
//! **Problem:** FO4Edit's `-autoexit` flag is unreliable. Even after the script completes
//! successfully and writes the log file, the main window often remains open indefinitely.
//! This blocks the workflow from continuing.
//!
//! **Solution:** The [`close_fo4edit_window`](FO4EditRunner::close_fo4edit_window) function forcefully
//! closes the window using a two-step process:
//! 1. Send `WM_CLOSE` message to request graceful shutdown
//! 2. Wait 2 seconds, then use `taskkill /F` as a fallback
//!
//! **This is NOT inefficient code - the `-autoexit` flag cannot be relied upon.**
//!
//! See original batch script lines 499-511 for the same workaround.
//!
//! # Mod Organizer 2 Support
//!
//! When configured with [`with_mo2`](FO4EditRunner::with_mo2), FO4Edit is launched through
//! MO2's virtual file system. This ensures FO4Edit sees mods in the correct load order and
//! can access files from MO2's staging directories.
//!
//! **Important:** MO2 introduces timing delays. The original batch script uses 5-10 second
//! delays after launching tools through MO2 to allow the VFS to synchronize. These delays
//! are built into this implementation and are NOT arbitrary.
//!
//! See original batch script lines 169, 436, 497, 513 for MO2 timing delays.
//!
//! # Error Detection
//!
//! FO4Edit writes detailed logs during script execution. This module:
//! - Deletes old log files before each operation (ensures fresh error detection)
//! - Waits for the log file to be created (indicates script has started)
//! - Parses the log for error patterns:
//!   - [`LOG_ERROR`]: General error indicator ("Error:")
//!   - [`LOG_SUCCESS`]: Success indicator ("Completed: No Errors.")
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::path::Path;
//! use generateprevisibines::tools::fo4edit::FO4EditRunner;
//!
//! let fo4edit_exe = Path::new("C:\\Games\\FO4Edit\\FO4Edit.exe");
//! let fo4_dir = Path::new("C:\\Games\\Fallout4");
//!
//! let runner = FO4EditRunner::new(fo4edit_exe, fo4_dir);
//!
//! // Step 5: Merge PrecombineObjects.esp
//! runner.merge_combined_objects("MyMod.esp")?;
//!
//! // Step 8: Merge Previs.esp
//! runner.merge_previs("MyMod.esp")?;
//! # Ok::<(), anyhow::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! # Platform Requirements
//!
//! **Windows only.** FO4Edit automation requires:
//! - Windows `SendInput` API for keyboard automation
//! - Windows `FindWindowW` API for window detection
//! - Windows `SendMessageW` API for window closing
//! - `taskkill.exe` for force-close fallback
//!
//! Non-Windows platforms will get compile-time errors.
//!

/// # Key Features
///
/// - **Keyboard Automation**: Automatically dismisses Module Selection dialog via SendInput API
/// - **Force Close**: Ensures FO4Edit window closes even when `-autoexit` fails
/// - **Log Parsing**: Detects errors from log files for reliable error detection
/// - **MO2 Support**: Can launch FO4Edit through Mod Organizer 2's virtual file system
/// - **Plugins.txt Management**: Creates temporary plugin lists for script execution
///
/// # Automation Workflow
///
/// Each script execution follows this process:
/// 1. **Create Plugins.txt**: Writes plugin name to temporary file for FO4Edit to load
/// 2. **Delete old log**: Ensures fresh error detection by removing previous log files
/// 3. **Launch FO4Edit**: Starts FO4Edit with script arguments (optionally through MO2)
/// 4. **Send ENTER keystroke**: Dismisses Module Selection dialog (REQUIRED WORKAROUND)
/// 5. **Wait for log**: Polls for log file creation (indicates script is running)
/// 6. **Wait for completion**: Allows script to finish execution (5-second delay)
/// 7. **Force close window**: Sends WM_CLOSE + taskkill fallback (REQUIRED WORKAROUND)
/// 8. **Parse log**: Checks for error patterns to determine success/failure
/// 9. **Cleanup**: Removes temporary Plugins.txt file

    /// - **2 seconds**: Wait for graceful close (before taskkill fallback)
    ///
    /// **These delays are REQUIRED, not arbitrary.** They account for:
    /// - FO4Edit initialization time
    /// - MO2 VFS synchronization
    /// - Script execution time
    /// - Window message processing

    /// **CRITICAL REQUIRED WORKAROUND - DO NOT REMOVE**

    /// after script completion. Even after the script finishes successfully and writes the log
    /// file, the window often remains open indefinitely, blocking the workflow from continuing.
    ///
    /// **This is NOT inefficient code - the `-autoexit` flag cannot be relied upon.**
    ///
    /// # Why This Workaround Exists
    ///
    /// FO4Edit's `-autoexit` flag is supposed to close the application after a script completes,
    /// but in practice it is extremely unreliable:
    /// - Sometimes the window stays open even after successful completion
    /// - Sometimes it closes but with significant delay (30+ seconds)
    /// - The behavior is inconsistent across different FO4Edit versions
    ///
    /// The original batch script (lines 499-511) used the same workaround: wait for the log
    /// file to be written (indicating completion), then forcefully close the window using
    /// PowerShell's process termination.
    ///
    /// # Process
    ///
    /// This function uses a two-step approach to ensure the window closes:
    ///
    /// 1. **Graceful close attempt**: Sends `WM_CLOSE` message to the FO4Edit window
    ///    - Finds window by title "FO4Edit" using `FindWindowW`
    ///    - Sends `WM_CLOSE` message using `SendMessageW`
    ///    - Allows FO4Edit to clean up resources and exit gracefully
    ///
    /// 2. **Wait 2 seconds**: Gives FO4Edit time to respond to WM_CLOSE
    ///
    /// 3. **Force close fallback**: Uses `taskkill /F /IM FO4Edit.exe`
    ///    - Forcefully terminates the process if still running
    ///    - Ensures the workflow can continue even if WM_CLOSE was ignored
    ///    - Errors are silently ignored (process may have already exited)
    ///
    /// # Window Not Found Behavior
    ///
    /// If the FO4Edit window is not found:
    /// - The function proceeds directly to the `taskkill` fallback
    /// - This is normal if FO4Edit has already exited (rare but possible)
    ///
    /// # Return Value
    ///
    /// This function does not return a value (it's infallible). All errors are silently ignored:
    /// - Window not found → Continue to taskkill
    /// - WM_CLOSE fails → Continue to taskkill
    /// - taskkill fails → Ignore (process may have already exited)
    ///
    /// **Why ignore errors?** By the time this function is called, the log file has already
    /// been written and parsed. The script work is complete. Whether the window closes
    /// gracefully or forcefully doesn't affect workflow success.
    ///
    /// # Platform Support
    ///
    /// **Windows only.** This function uses Windows-specific APIs and tools:
    /// - `FindWindowW`: Locate window by title
    /// - `SendMessageW`: Send WM_CLOSE message
    /// - `taskkill.exe`: Force-terminate process
    ///
    /// On non-Windows platforms, this function is a no-op (does nothing).
    ///
    /// # Timing Considerations
    ///
    /// - **2-second wait**: Allows FO4Edit to respond to WM_CLOSE before force-killing
    ///
    /// **This delay is REQUIRED.** It gives FO4Edit a chance to clean up properly before
    /// resorting to forced termination.
